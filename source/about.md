A self-taught software engineer from computer and control systems education background.

I am working as a Senior iOS Development Engineer at [Screening Eagle Dreamlab](https://screeningeagle.com/) Singapore.

My online resume is available at [Stack Overflow Developer Story](https://stackoverflow.com/story/jessearmand). Please take a look to understand more about my professional history.

I have worked mostly on mobile applications development on iOS, and will continue to do so for the native / web platform. In general, I'm looking forward to the potential of Swift development ecosystem as a full stack platform, in addition to macOS / iOS.

I have been working on iOS platform for since 2008. At that time, I was fascinated and intrigued by the iOS when Apple released the first SDK to developers all over the world with iPhone being hackable and having the same base system as OS X.

The first professional work was started during my transition from cross-platform Qt framework while working with Mac OS X platform. Ever since, I have familiarized myself through the iOS developer community and what they came up with. Afterwards, I continued working on various projects related to iOS and also node.js for a short time.

As a software engineer, I have witnessed a few hype cycles since the App Store, and the proliferation of mobile platform, big data, data science, fintech, cryptocurrency and AI. All of those have fueled innovation, funding, and economic growth, and you can trace back how one hype cycle will generate the next hype cycle with failures in between before a technology reach maturity.

At maturity level, people more or less have seen what it is capable of and they have the ability to discern the usefulness of various products in the market and how it affect their lives. There are not that many variations of a particular platform at this level (e.g. the market is dominated only by iOS or Android on mobile, macOS or Windows on the desktop).

Technological progress sustained and at most automated the ways in which we live our lives. But, we don't strive to actually improve human condition on the whole, because it's probable that most of our effort is only about self-preservation. Moreover, we don't exactly understand what is an improvement, and everyone has their own subjective idea of it.

From now on, I would look into not only on the practical side of software engineering with commercial applications, but also on the theoretical or social side of computer science, mathematics, minds, brains, machines, and how do they interact as a whole.

It's a very abstract goal that very few will understand, but it's probably the only goal left to pursue.
