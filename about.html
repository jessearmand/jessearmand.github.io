        <p>A self-taught software engineer from computer and control systems education background.</p>
<p>I am working as a Senior iOS Development Engineer at <a href="https://screeningeagle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Screening Eagle Dreamlab</a> Singapore.</p>
<p>My online resume is available at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/story/jessearmand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow Developer Story</a>. Please take a look to understand more about my professional history.</p>
<p>I have been working on iOS platform since 2008. At that time, I was fascinated and intrigued by the iOS when Apple released the first SDK to developers all over the world with iPhone being hackable and having the same base system as OS X.</p>
<p>Since then, I have worked mostly on mobile applications development on iOS, and will continue to do so for the native / web platform. In general, I’m looking forward to the potential of Swift development ecosystem as a full stack platform, in addition to macOS / iOS. However, throughout the years I have also dedicated some time into engineering work that is not necessarily specific to Apple’s platform. </p>
<p>But, on the frontend side basically there are only 3 choices available in order to make a career out of it. That is the <em>browser</em> which we call <em>the web</em> and Android or iOS on a mobile device or smartphone. Apart from that, it’s likely that a VR unit such as Oculus Rift would become the next <em>frontend</em>, especially as the world are preparing for incoming pandemics, human interactions may or in the worst case be considered unsafe. People will need a better interface to interact with the outside world and with each other. </p>
<p>As an analog to VR, an FPV unit is a cheaper and practical system that has been used by hobbyists and professionals. This is especially apparent in Drone Racing, and we can obviously see its application in robotics or any remote sensing application, where you need a live video feed of a remote operation. AR which is now popular in smartphones, will have a better form as a headset. If we couple a digital FPV unit with augmented reality layer, we would have a much better experience on an FPV unit. </p>
<p>Although, we will not see these two industries (AR and FPV) merging anytime soon. I can see the connection between the two, plus VR. I do wish pandemics are solvable, but we or at least I have to prepare for the worst.</p>
